#Showtime

The showtime application was created with movie lovers in mind. It allows a user to input the name of a movie and
also list actors. It is a great way to put down your favorite movies and those who acted in it. 

## Installation


Retrieve the included Gemfile and Run the following command
```
bundle install
```

## Usage

To use the app run
```
ruby app.rb
```
Navigate in your browser to localhost:4567. 

From the main page you will be presented with all actors and movies that have already been created, if any. Also there
will be links to go to the pages to add actors or add movies. Once you add an actor/movie you can then go to the individual
page of each and add any movies they are apart of or any actors apart of the movie.
